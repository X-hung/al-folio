Hi, 👋

Welcome to my personal website, where I will update my work status, ongoing projects, as well as published blogs and papers. 
Here is a brief introduction to myself: 

I recently graduated from the University of Sydney in Australia, with two Master's degrees, which are related to computer science and management. Prior to this, I obtained a Bachelor of Engineering Degree in Computer Science in China. Currently, I have been admitted to the Chinese University of Hong Kong, where I plan to study for a Master of Philosophy degree in 2023 (maybe).

##### # Working Interest

I would like to work in various industries (e.g. IT, Finance, Healthcare, Education) as a software engineer, specification could be web development, cloud native application development, AI-driven application development, and project managment or consulting.

##### # Research Interest
My current research interests are focused on computer science and software engineering, including but not limited to distributed systems, cloud computing, database systems, and human-computer interaction, I am also fine with AI-related topics (not too much).

I have a tendency to pursue a doctorate degree. If you can provide relevant research opportunities, please feel free to contact me at your earliest convenience. I will appreciate it.
