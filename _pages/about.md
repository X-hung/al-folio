Hi, ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my personal website, where I will update my work status, ongoing projects, as well as published blogs and papers. 
Here is a brief introduction to me: 

I graduated from an ordinary university in China with a bachelor's degree in computer science. I currently have two master's degrees from the University of Sydney in Australia, which are related to computer science and management. I plan to study for a Master of philosophy degree at the Chinese University of Hong Kong next year.

##### Working Interest

I would like to work in various industries as a software engineer, specification could be web development, cloud native application development, AI-driven application development, and project managment or consultant.

##### Research Interest
My current research interests are focused on computer science and software engineering, including but not limited to distributed systems and cloud computing, database systems, human-computer interaction, I am also fine with AI-related topics (a little bit).

I have a tendency to study for a doctorate degree. If you can provide relevant research opportunities, please feel free to contact me at your earlist convenience.
